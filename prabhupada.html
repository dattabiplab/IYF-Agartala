            ISKCON is a non-profit organization that works for social welfare.
            He was a genuine holy person with enormous integrity and compassion,
            and he had a powerful impact on those who met him. He never claimed
            authority and respect for himself; what he said and did was always
            in the name of Krishna” – Dr Thomas J. Hopkins.
          </p>
          <p>
            When His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Śrīla Prabhupāda
            entered the port of New York City on September 17, 1965 few
            Americans took notice — but he was not merely another immigrant. He
            was on a mission to introduce the ancient teachings of Vedic India
            into mainstream America. Before Śrīla Prabhupāda passed away on
            November 14, 1977 at the age of 81, his mission proved successful.
            He had founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness
            (ISKCON) and saw it grow into a worldwide confederation of more than
            100 temples, ashrams and cultural centers.

            class="prabhupada-image"
          />
          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Śrīla Prabhupāda was born Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896 to a
            pious Hindu family in Calcutta. As a youth growing up in
            British-controlled India, Abhay became involved with Mahatma
            Gandhi’s civil disobedience movement to secure independence for his
            nation. It was, however, a 1922 meeting with a prominent scholar and
            religious leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, which proved most
            influential on Abhay’s future calling. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a
            leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava denomination, a monotheistic
            tradition within the broad Hindu culture, and asked Abhay to bring
            the teachings of Lord Krishna to the English-speaking world. Abhay
            became a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and resolved to
            carry out his mentor’s request. Abhay, later known by the honorific
            A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, spent the next 32 years
            preparing for his journey west.

            class="prabhupada-image"
          />
          <h3>Expanding Boundaries</h3>
          <p>
            In 1965, at the age of sixty-nine, Śrīla Prabhupāda traveled to New
            York City aboard a cargo ship. The journey was treacherous, and the
            elderly spiritual teacher suffered two heart attacks aboard ship.
            Arriving in the United States with just seven dollars in Indian
            rupees and his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts, Śrīla
            Prabhupāda began to share the timeless wisdom of Krishna
            consciousness. His message of peace and goodwill resonated with many
            young people, some of whom came forward to become serious students
            of the Krishna tradition. With the help of these students, Śrīla
            Prabhupāda rented a small storefront on New York’s Lower East Side
            to use as a temple. On July 11, 1966, he officially registered his
            organization in the state of New York, formally founding the
            International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

            alt="srila prabhupada dancing and doing kirtan with his disciples in rath Yatra"
            class="prabhupada-image"
          />
          <p>
            In the eleven years that followed, Śrīla Prabhupāda circled the
            globe 14 times on lecture tours, bringing the teachings of Lord
            Krishna to thousands of people on six continents. Men and women from
            all backgrounds and walks of life came forward to accept his
            message, and with their help, Śrīla Prabhupāda established ISKCON
            centers and projects throughout the world. Under his inspiration,
            Krishna devotees established temples, rural communities, educational
            institutions, and started what would become the world’s largest
            vegetarian food relief program. With the desire to nourish the roots
            of Krishna consciousness in its home, Śrīla Prabhupāda returned to
            India several times, where he sparked a revival in the Vaishnava
            tradition. In India, he opened dozens of temples, including large
            centers in the holy towns of Vrindavan and Mayapur.
          </p>
          <h3>His Message to Society</h3>
          <p>
            Śrīla Prabhupāda’s most significant contributions, perhaps, are his
            books. He authored over 70 volumes on the Krishna tradition, which
            are highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth,
            fidelity to the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are
            used as textbooks in numerous college courses. His writings have
            been translated into 76 languages. His most prominent works include:
            Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the 30-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the
            17-volume Sri Caitanya-caritamrita.
          </p>
          <p>Prabhupada’s teachings emphasized:</p>
          <li>
            The Science of Bhakti-Yoga: Pure devotion to Krishna as the highest
            spiritual practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Importance of Guru-Disciple Tradition: Receiving knowledge
            through an unbroken spiritual lineage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simple Living, High Thinking: Rejecting excessive materialism for a
            life of spiritual growth.
          </li>

          <h3>His Achievements</h3>
          <p>
            Srila Prabhupada came back to India with a wish to cultivate the
            better roots of Lord Krishna. He opened numerous temples and one of
            the largest centers of ISKCON in the holy towns of Mayapur and
            Vrindavana. The most imperative contribution of Srila Prabhupada is
            conceivably his books. He wrote more than 70 volumes on the
            tradition of Krishna, which Scholars highly appreciate because of
            its depth, clarity, and faithfulness toward the tradition. Several
            colleges have used his work in textbooks, and all his books have
            been already translated into 76 different languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            His lifetime achievements are innumerable, magnificent, and
            extraordinary. Some of his achievements are listed below:
