      <h2 class="section-title">About ISKCON Youth Forum Agartala</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="hero-content">
      <p>
        The ISKCON Youth Forum (IYF) Agartala is a dedicated wing of the
        International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) that focuses on
        nurturing and guiding the youth toward a life of purpose, devotion, and
        joy. Situated in Math Chowmuhani, Agartala, the forum offers a welcoming
        space where young minds can explore spiritual wisdom, develop leadership
        skills, and engage in uplifting community activities. Our mission is to
        help youth harmonize their personal, academic, and professional lives
        with timeless spiritual values.
      </p>
      <h3>Srila Prabhupada – The Visionary Founder</h3>
      <p>
        His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, the
        founder-acharya of ISKCON, is the guiding inspiration for our forum. In
        1965, Srila Prabhupada traveled to the West at the age of 69 with the
        aim of sharing the ancient wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad
        Bhagavatam with the world. Through tireless effort, he established
        ISKCON in 1966 in New York City and inspired millions globally. <br />
        Srila Prabhupada envisioned youth as torchbearers of a spiritual
        revolution—leaders who could blend modern education with Vedic wisdom to
        create a compassionate and God-conscious society. IYF Agartala strives
        to carry forward this vision by providing mentorship, education, and
        engagement opportunities that help young people realize their highest
        potential.
      </p>
